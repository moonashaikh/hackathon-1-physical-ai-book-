# Chapter 1: Introduction to Physical AI

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI is an emerging field that combines artificial intelligence with physical systems, particularly robotics. It focuses on creating AI systems that can perceive, reason, and act in the physical world, bridging the gap between digital intelligence and physical embodiment.

## Key Concepts

- **Embodied Cognition**: The idea that intelligence emerges from the interaction between an agent and its environment
- **Perception-Action Loop**: The continuous cycle of sensing, processing, and acting in the physical world
- **Physical Reasoning**: The ability to understand and predict physical phenomena

## Applications

Physical AI has numerous applications including:

- Autonomous robots for manufacturing and logistics
- Assistive robots for healthcare and elderly care
- Exploration robots for hazardous environments
- Educational robots for STEM learning

## The Physical AI Stack

The Physical AI stack consists of several layers:

1. **Hardware Layer**: Sensors, actuators, and physical platforms
2. **Control Layer**: Low-level control systems for movement and manipulation
3. **Perception Layer**: Computer vision, audio processing, and sensor fusion
4. **Cognition Layer**: Planning, reasoning, and decision-making
5. **Interaction Layer**: Human-robot interaction and communication

## Next Steps

In the next chapter, we'll explore the basics of humanoid robotics and how Physical AI principles are applied to create human-like robotic systems.
